                I am a dedicated software engineer specializing in data engineering
                and data systems at Ally Financial. In this role, I play a crucial
                part in supporting our business data needs, developing robust data
                solutions that drive strategic decisions and enhance operational
                efficiencies. My professional journey in data systems began after
                my academic studies at Wayne State University, where I honed my
                skills and fueled my passion for technology.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond my specialization, I have a keen interest in a variety of
                technology domains. I am constantly engaged in writing, designing,
                and building new projects, driven by a desire to explore and
                innovate. My passion for tech is complemented by creative
                problem-solving, and I am always eager to expand my horizons and
                engage with new ideas in the tech world.
                <br>
                <br>
                My personal story is marked by a significant chapter when I became
                a refugee from Kosovo, moving to Michigan in 1999 to escape the war.
                This experience has profoundly shaped my perspective and
                resilience. Since then, I was raised in Metro Detroit, a community
                that has played a pivotal role in both my personal and professional
                life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of work, my interests are diverse and reflect my curiosity
                about the world. I have a passion for photography, capturing moments
                and landscapes that tell stories. Other aveneus where I
                find joy and relaxation are: surf-skating, building legos,
                music, and soccer. I also cherish traveling, as it offers me
                opportunities to explore new cultures and environments, further
                broadening my worldview.

            <hr>
            <p>
                I created this website because Kosovar-Albanians (at least my family) do not
                really have much of a written legacy left behind. This is partially due
                to lack of record keeping, loss of records during wars like in 1999,
                and numerous Ottoman wars, and also probably because of the fact that
                Albania, and especially Kosova, were not sovereign countries for thousands of years.
                <br>
                <br>
                I wanted to create a website for myself for the purpose of keeping records on who I am.
                Half of my family is overseas in Kosova -- many of them do not know much about me
                (some probably do not even know of my existence to be honest). On top of all of this, I
                do not have any family in North Carolina. They are all in Michigan. And do not forget recruiters
                (wink).

                To be honest with you, I do not like brutalist architecture at all.
                It reminds me of communism too much (yes, I know brutalism is not from
                communism). Anyways, most of the time the architecture is kind of an eye-sore.
                Especially in London.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having said that, brutalism/neo-brutalism web-design is pretty. It is simple, easy
                to navigate, and easy to maintain.
                <br>
                <br>
                I kind of got the idea to go with a neo-brutalism design randomly when I was in the
                Museum der bildenden KÃ¼nste in Leipzig, Germany. Something about that building
                made me want to design my website to be raw and spacious. I hope I succeeded.

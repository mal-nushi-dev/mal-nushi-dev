            <hr>
            <p>
                The Bellroy Transit Workpack (20L) may have been the first expensive backpack I have bought. I have
                quite a lot to say about it, but I will always remember it as the backpack that brought me into this
                expensive interest of backpacks.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Bellroy Transpit Workpack starts at $199. It is marketed at 20 liters, has a clam-shell type design 
                for the main compartment, and is pretty sleek with minimal compartments.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">Why Did I Buy It?</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I bought the backpack without actually giving it proper test run. Bellroy, for me, almost
                never misses when it comes to design. I wanted something minimal, and a backpack that I can both 
                use as a travel backpack, but also something casual that I can use personally and for work.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">The Pros</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                One of the pros of this backpack for me was the material quality. I went overseas with this backpack a couple
                of times and have taken it across the country and it has held up pretty well. I had no rips on the outershell,
                shoulder pads, or the elastic parts of the backpack.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another pro, which is important to me, is that the backpack was fairly easy to clean. Light colored backpacks
                such as the one I owned can be prone to getting dirty. In my case, the backpack did not actually get all that
                dirty when it was worn around, put on the ground, and when taken on a hike. When it did get dirty, I just put
                it into the washing machine and it came out looking new.
                <br>
                <br>
                The bag really does hold about 20 liters. What I like about this backpack is that it is kind of modular in
                the fact that you can really put anything you want in the main compartment. Whether you are packing clothes for
                a weekend trip, or bringing your gym clothes for after work -- it can hold quite a bit. When I put books, and my
                iPad in there, I never felt things shuffling inside the backpack either.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am 50/50 on the water bottle slot. In one end it can hold my Yeti tumbler, in the other end, it protrudes inside
                the bag. That is sometimes the problem with these types of backpacks: you get a sleek profile when 
                the water bottle slot is hidden, but you also lose some space in the interior.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">The Cons</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Oh man. There are honestly a lot of cons to this backpack. In the quickest way possible: it is not worth
                the $199 price tag.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a subjective opinion, but I actually do not really like the real-life design of this backpack.
                It looks off. I am not quite sure how to explain it -- but it never looks symmetrical. It looks wider than it
                should be, or slanted due to its baggy design.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also have a big gripe with the shoulder straps which slip very often. Aside from the slippage which can cause
                shoulder pain, the shoulder pads hurt all together. For a $199 backpack, I expect the shoulder pads to be
                much more padded than they are.
                <br>
                <br>
                The water bottle holder is ok. I actually like it when backpacks find clever ways to hide the water bottle
                holders. In this case, Bellroy allows you to use the water bottle slot as both a compartment slot and for your
                water bottle. Having said that, I have had multiple spills due to me clumsily forgetting to properly secure
                my bottle -- which means, I have had a fair share of spills. And those spills seep into the bag itself. I may
                be too strict on Bellroy here, but $199 is $199, and $199 is not cheap.
                <br>
                <br>
                Speaking of $199, some of the best backpack makers who sell bags at this price offer great warranty. Companies like
                North Face, Osprey, and Timbuk2 all offer better warranty than Bellroy's 3-year warranty. It is a shame honestly.
                While I do not believe Bellroy uses cheap materials, at least in my experience everything was fine, you would expect
                a company like Bellroy who sells really expensive bags to offer a lifetime warranty on their products.

            <hr>
            <p>
                The Bellroy Transit Workpack (20L) marks my first purcahase of a high-end backpack. 
                It was not just a purchase but an entry into a newfound, and expensive, interest in backpacks.
                <br>
                <br>
                Priced starting at $199, the Bellroy Transit Workpack offers a 20-liter capacity and features a sleek, 
                clamshell design that is minimalistic yet functional. It's marketed for those who value both style and 
                practicality in their daily commute or occasional travel.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">Why Did I Buy It?</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I purchased the Bellroy Transit Workpack without a proper test run. I trusted the brand's reputation
                for design. My aim was to find something minimal -- a versatile piece that could seamlessly transition
                from a travel essential to a casual accessory for personal and work use.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">The Pros</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                One of the standout features of this backpack is its material quality. I went overseas with this
                backpack a couple of times and have taken it across the country, and it has held up pretty well.
                I had no rips on the outershell, shoulder pads, or the elastic parts. This bag is made from premium,
                environmentally certified leather and durable, water-resistant woven fabric sourced from recycled
                materials.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another pro, which is important to me, is how easy the backpack was to clean. Light-colored backpacks,
                such as the one I owned, are prone to getting dirty, but this one stayed relatively clean despite
                being worn frequently, placed on the ground, and even taken on hikes. When it did get dirty,
                a simple cycle in the washing machine returned it to looking like new.
                <br>
                <br>
                The backpack's capacity is also impressive; it holds 20 liters. I appreciate the modular design, which
                allows you to pack virtually anything in the main compartment. Whether I am packing clothes for a
                weekend getawa or gym gear for a post-work session, it accomodates a substantial amount. The compartment
                is stable too; even when filled with books and an iPad, the contents do not shuffle around.
                <br>
                <br>
                The laptop compartment is secure and well-designed, lined with felt to protect devices. It comfortably
                fits both my MacBook Air and my 16-inch Dell work computer, without any issue of being too small or too
                large. Additionally, there's a convenient compartment near the laptop zipper for storing charging cables
                or a tech organizer, which I find quite handy.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have mixed feelings about the water bottle slot. On one hand, it perfectly fits my Yeti tumbler; on
                the other, it tends to protrude into the bag's interior space. This is a common issue with sleek
                backpack designs where the water bottle slot is integrated into the profile, sacrificing some
                internal capacity.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">The Cons</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                While this backpack has its pros, there are several drawbacks that make it very difficult to justify the
                $199 price tag.
                <br>
                <br>
                Firstly, as much as I liked the look of the backpack in advertisements, in reality, the design
                aesthetics
                are disappointing. The backpack consistently appears asymmetrical -- either too wide or oddly slanted,
                which might be due to its baggy design. This unexpected shape can be visually off-putting to some. And
                by
                some, I mean me and everyone else who has commented on it -- which was everyone that saw me wear it.
                <br>
                <br>
                A major concern is the shoulder straps, which frequently slip. This not only causes discomfort but can
                also lead to shoulder pain. Considering the price, I expected the shoulder pads to be more generously
                padded. Additionally, the absence of a sternum strap on the standard size is a significant oversight
                for a backpack marketed for transit. Larger sizes include this feature, but it should be standard across
                all sizes for better support and comfort.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another practicality issue is the lack of a luggage strap. This would be extremely useful for travel,
                especially at airports, to avoid the strain of carrying the backpack on your shoulders all
                dayâ€”exacerbated by the strap slippage and missing sternum strap.
                <br>
                <br>
                The water bottle holder design is somewhat effective, allowing dual use as a compartment.
                However, I've experienced numerous spills because the bottle was not properly secured, leading to
                leakage inside the bag. While functional, this feature requires careful handling to prevent messes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, considering the cost, Bellroy's 3-year warranty feels inadequate compared to competitors like
                North Face, Osprey, and Timbuk2, who offer more extensive warranty terms. For a premium-priced backpack,
                a more consumer friendly warranty policy would be expected to assure buyers of its
                long-term durability and value.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">Conclusion</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Bellroy Transit Workpack (20L) represents my inital venture into high-end backpacks, a journey that
                has absolutely killed my wallet, but has been enlightening. While the marketing boasts about features
                such as durable materials, easy maintenance, and a secure, modular design, it also presents significant
                drawbacks that undermine its value.
                <br>
                <br>
                The design, although sleek, suffers from practical flaws such as the weird asymmetry look and a lack of
                essential features like a sternum strap and luggage strap, which diminish its usability, especially for
                frequent travelers. The annoying strap slippage and slim padding contribute to discomfort, making it 
                less ideal for prolonged use. Additionally, the water bottle compartment proved problematic wiht its
                tendency to cause spills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Comparatively, the backpack's warranty falls short of what is offered by its competitors at the same
                price point, raising concerns about its long-term value and the brand's confidence in its product
                durability.
                <br>
                <br>
                In conclusion, while the Bellroy Transit Workpack has its pros, the cons I highlighted make it difficult
                to recommend. I would consider other options in the market that offer better functionality and customer
                assurance for a similar investment.
